# PongMP
A multiplayer version of Pong. Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.
Alright so here is the deal I am not sure how to make a game online multiplayer so for now here is Pong I can definitley add some textures but for now this project is over if you really
want to play this with a friend online you can use a program called Parsec and go and play from that point 
anyways have fun!
